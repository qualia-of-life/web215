<h1>
Tavares Meadows
WEB 215
Course Contract
</h1>


<p id="contract">

    I, Tavares Meadows agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my WEB 215 Advanced Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.<br><br>

    I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br><br>

    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.<br><br>

    Signed: Tavares Meadows, 8/26/13
